The content of the Final project:
This final project includes an R script, an R Markdown (RMD) file, and an HTML file. Additionally, it contains a folder with the data used in these files, as well as all the figures.

Focus of the study:
I) This project explores witch trials in Denmark during the 16th and 17th centuries. It examines how these trials changed over time, especially in relation to the 1617 law on witchcraft. 
II) The project also looks at where in Denmark the trials took place and how local cases were connected to higher courts, particularly the Viborg Landsting. What can the results tell us about the legal system of the time? 
III) Finally, the project examines the gender roles involved in the trials, focusing on who was accused and who made the accusations, as well as the marital status of the accused.
