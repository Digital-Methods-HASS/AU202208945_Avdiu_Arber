# 1st parameter: We will investigate the effect of the 1617 law that banned both black and white magic in Denmark, and examine how this legislation influenced the rise of witch trials.

# Skills: Interactive Maps in R

#2nd parameter: We look at where witch trials happened in Denmark. We also want to examine the connection between local cases and higher courts ("Viborg Landsting"): Which cases from which parishes/cities ended up in Viborg Landsting? What can the results tell us about the legal system of the time?

#Explanation of why less than half of the city coordinates are included? In the Witchcraft_dataset.csv, there are a total of 484 witchcraft cases involving various locations. However, only about half of the city coordinates (232) are included in the Capturing_Coordinates.csv file. This can be explained by three main factors:
  
# 1. Some city names appear multiple times in the dataset but are only included once in the coordinates file.

# 2. Many of the parishes or towns are outdated due to the historical period, and they could not be located by Google Maps.

# 3. In the available material from the Viborg court records, the location is often missing and marked as NA (missing data).
